Hangman Game
Welcome to Hangman, a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. This console application challenges players to uncover a randomly selected word by guessing letters one at a time. Incorrect guesses lead to the drawing of a hangman figure, and players must solve the word before running out of attempts.

Features
Word Selection: The game randomly picks a word from a predefined list, providing a diverse and challenging experience for players.

Interactive Interface: Players input letters to guess the word, and the game displays the current state of the word with underscores representing unrevealed letters.

Guess Tracking: The application keeps track of guessed letters, updating the word display to reveal correct guesses and maintaining a list of incorrect attempts.

Hangman Art: For each incorrect guess, a visual representation of the hangman figure is displayed using ASCII art, adding an engaging and visual element to the game.

Play Again Option: After completing a round or running out of attempts, players have the option to play again, creating an interactive and user-friendly experience.
